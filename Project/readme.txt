The Game: MasterMind
Katie Davenport

MasterMind Design 

This MasterMind program utilizes Marble and Gameboard classes coupled with 
procedural programming to manage files, setup the gameboard, and play the game.
Rather than clicking on marbles and images to drive the game, a user interface 
is implemented that allows players to enter guesses and desired game actions. 
Core game functions include: generating the secret code, gathering player 
input, counting cows and bulls, and displaying guesses. A main orchestration
function utilizes a while loop to allow the player to guess up to ten times. 
Helper functions that handle files and the board setup are imported from 
additional files. 

A future version of this program will focus on replacing the user interface 
with functionality that allows the player to drive the game by clicking on 
the marbles and images in the play area. 

Thank you for playing!
