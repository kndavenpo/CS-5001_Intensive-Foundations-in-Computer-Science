CS 5001: Intensive Foundations in Computer Science, Align MS in Computer Science, Northeastern University, Spring 2022

## Description 
This project contains homework and exam files for CS 5001: Intensive Foundations in Computer Science. This course is part of core requirements for the Align MS in Computer Science program at Khoury College of Computer Science at Northeastern University (www.khoury.northeastern.edu/programs/align-masters-of-science-in-computer-science/). 

Course description:  Introduces systematic problem solving through programming. Offers students an opportunity to learn how to analyze a problem, how to divide and organize the problem into appropriate components, how to describe the problem in a computer language, how to analyze and understand the behavior of their programs, and how to test that their programs are working correctly. Additionally, introduces a method of program design called object-oriented programming and various ways to organize data, including a discussion of their advantages and disadvantages. To practice the course concepts, students undertake assignments ranging from small, highly specified programming tasks to larger open-ended problems where students design and code their own solutions.

Programming language: Python  

Professor: Keith Bagley, Associate Clinical Professor, Director - Align Boston
