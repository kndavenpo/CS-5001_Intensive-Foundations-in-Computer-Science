    Homework 2 - Programming #3: Align Draw
    Katie Davenport

    This program draws a square and circle using the Python Turtle library.
    The program erases the first set of shapes and re-draws them to a new
    location determined by user input. The required functions are in the
    align_draw.py file. 
'''

# Import function required to complete the program.
from align_draw import run_program
 
def main():

    # Run the function that drives the process specified.
    run_program()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
